## [SSH](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Secure-Shell)
SSH stands for secure shell, helps to remotely connect to the servers.
Before using SSH `Telnet` used to remotely connect the servers, which not involves any encryption
and prone to man in the middle attacks.

SSH creating a secure channel between local and remote computers,
SSH is used to manage routers, server hardware, virtualization platforms, 
operating systems (OSes), and inside systems management and file transfer applications.

## [SSH Process in virtual machine](https://averagelinuxuser.com/ssh-into-virtualbox/)
- Installation of ssh-server (sshd automatically installed) in the host machine, such that which the machine to be accessed
- Installation of ssh-client in the machine which supposed to be accessing the remote server
- Applying the NAT Rule 

## [SSH Passwordless Login](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tutorial/Use-ssh-keygen-to-create-SSH-key-pairs-and-more)
- In general ssh into the system was password protected, everyime we enter the system  we need to give the password to enter the system.
- We can achieve the password login on sharing the ssh public key to the source machine

Steps:
### SSH key pair generation
```
// generating the ssh key pair
ssh-keygen

```

### Copy the public key to the destination machine (where we do need to connect)
```
// copy public key from source to destination
ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/<name>.pub <detination-server>
```

### To verify cat on the authorized_keys
```
// can find the public key here (destination server)
cat /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
